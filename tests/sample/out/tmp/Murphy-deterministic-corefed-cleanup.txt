Miracles thicker than fog on flight of No 10607.
It was the day after Christmas.
As I was wheeled backward through the glaring hospital corridor, rows of overhead lights looming up behind I like little suns and then fading away to the front, I remember thinking that this day was just 45 years since the day of the five miracles.
The miracles that had come just after Christmas so long ago.
The anesthetist had warned I that the operating room would feel cold.
The anesthetist came to introduce The anesthetist to I in the little cubicle where I lay on the gurney.
I's Kathleen, Kathleen, held I's hand and tried to look calm.
But even the corridor already felt cold in I's hospital gown.
Everything was in slow motion.
The distance to the operating room was probably only 100 feet, but the trip seemed to take half an hour.
I had plenty of time to think.
I remembered the lucky accident that brought I to this rolling gurney so early on a Tuesday morning the magnetic resonator imaging test that looked for a cause of hearing loss in I's left ear, but found instead, a tumor nestled against the left side of I's brain.
I looked it up in our family medical book, reading about paralysis, blindness, seizures, or worse.
I remembered the clear, calm voice of Dr John Wright who explained how he was going to cut a hole in I's skull and take it out; I remembered, too, Dr John Wright who explained how he was going to cut a hole in my skull and take it out; I remembered's calm recital of possible aftereffects.
I recalled Kathleen's marvelous calm as Christmas approached, as I frantically graded papers for 150 students at the university and tried to think of everything that needed doing before the operation.
I knew, though, that Kathleen was seething with worry.
Kathleen did not even blanch when I arranged to have Kathleen's signature added to the checking account for a small publishing business I ran outside of university time.
I remembered Christmas Day, with daughter Sheila and son Brian and Brian's Kathleen, Debbie, trying to act as if it were a normal day.
I felt the gurney shoulder its way through the swinging doors behind I.
The glare of the operating room surprised I.
So did the noise: chatter, clatter, rattle.
I saw Dr John Wright who explained how he was going to cut a hole in my skull and take it out; I remembered over to the right looking at four bright pictures suspended on the wall.
I had seen them before: I's own skull, with the bright, pearshaped tumor standing out against the darker background of brain and bone.
A clock on the wall said 10 minutes to 8 o'clock.
