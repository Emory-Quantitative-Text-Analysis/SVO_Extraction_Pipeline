The anesthetist had warned me that the operating room would feel cold. He came to introduce himself to me in the little cubicle where I lay on the gurney. My wife, Kathleen, held my hand and tried to look calm. But even the corridor already felt cold in my hospital gown. Everything was in slow motion. The distance to the operating room was probably only 100 feet, but the trip seemed to take half an hour. I had plenty of time to think. I remembered the lucky accident that brought me to this rolling gurney so early on a Tuesday morning - the magnetic resonator imaging test that looked for a cause of hearing loss in my left ear, but found instead, a tumor nestled against the left side of my brain. I looked it up in our family medical book, reading about paralysis, blindness, seizures, or worse.
